# DWA6
DWA_06: Abstraction

## Working version of BookConnect

### To be assessed:
- use objects and functions as abstractions to make the code more maintainable, extendable and easier to change
- adjust, change, remove or add abstractions to improve the codebase
- consider higher-level concepts discussed in the previous lessons(documentation, Styleguides and abstractions)
- required to talk about the “how” and “why” you made specific decisions and not just present the “what” of the decisions that you made
- rewrite code to make it easier to maintain, change and understand
